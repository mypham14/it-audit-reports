## Description


The objective of this project is to analyze Venmo company regarding its risk of losses due to cyber attacks and controls in place to mitigate that risk, projected to save the company $448B from cyber threats.

## Methodologies
• Conducted detailed research on SOC 1 compliance reporting, including its function, content and comparison with a SOX engagement
• Generated a research paper on logical access - an Information Technology General Control (ITGC) explaining its objective and significance in an audit, risks and controls (preventative, detective, and corrective) and tests that provide reasonable assurance of control objectives
• Provided an analysis of a cyber security breach including its summary, risks, actions taken and controls recommended to improve the company's security system and prevent financial losses from cyber attacks
• Collaborated with four team members to present a report on IBM's access management of its cloud services, including risk and management control assessment, data/processes flow diagram, audit programs and fieldwork, and recommendations to protect the company from cyber threats
