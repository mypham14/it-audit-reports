## Description

The objective of this project is to aconduct research on multiple information technology audit topics and provide recommendations on controls to mitigate the risk of financial losses due to cyber threats for companies analyzed, helping them improve their security systems.

## Methodologies
* **Assignment 1**: Conduct detailed research on SOC 1 compliance reporting, including its function, content and comparison with a SOX engagement
  - General description and timing of report
  - Reason why this report would be required and provide an example of an industry/company that would utilize this report
  - What types of items would you expect to find within your report based on your prior example
  - Explain general differences between your report and a SOX engagement
  - Explain the implications for a company that received a “failed” report
* **Assignment 2**: Generate a research paper on logical access - an Information Technology General Control (ITGC) explaining its objective and significance in an audit, risks and controls (preventative, detective, and corrective) and tests that provide reasonable assurance of control objectives
  - A brief overview of ITGC’s as well as explaining their overall objectives, how they are related to the “business” and why they are crucial for performing audits (i.e. the role ITGC’s play in SOX compliance or other attestation reports)
  - The risks associated with your assigned ITGC
  - Examples of control objectives surrounding your ITGC
  - Examples of preventative, detective, and corrective controls within your assigned ITGC.
  - A description and elaboration on which tests would be performed in order to provide
reasonable assurance for the identified control objective(s) above.
* **Assignment 3**: Provide an analysis of a cyber security breach including its summary, risks, actions taken and controls recommended to improve the company's security system and prevent financial losses from cyber attacks
  - A brief overview of the company: background, executive team, external auditors
  - Description of the breach
    - How it happened
    - Cost of the breach to the company: Tangible/Intangible
    - Who was involved: Outside parties, employees, etc.
  - Controls involved: that failed, controls that may have prevented the breach, etc.
  - Recommendations for your company
  - Did the company initially publicly disclose the breach? What is your opinion on if a company should disclose or not?
* **Assignment 4**: Present a report on IBM's access management of its cloud services, including risk and management control assessment, data/processes flow diagram, audit programs and fieldwork, and recommendations to protect the company from cyber threats
